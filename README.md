### Comparison

- **Server Privacy** An honest-but-curious server should not learn information about any user's location or contacts.
- **Source Integrity** Users cannot send reports to users they did not come in contact with or on behalf of other users.
- **Broadcast Integrity** Users cannot broadcast CENs they did not generate.
- **No Passive Tracking** A passive adversary monitoring Bluetooth connections should not be able to learn any information about the location of users who do not send reports.
- **Receiver Privacy** Users who receive reports do not reveal information to anyone.
- **Reporter Privacy** Users who send reports do not reveal information to users they did not come in contact with, and reveal only the time of contact to users they did come in contact with. Note that in practice, the timing alone may still be sufficient for their contact to learn their identity (e.g., if their contact was only around one other person at the time).
